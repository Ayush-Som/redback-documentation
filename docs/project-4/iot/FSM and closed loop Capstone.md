**Introduction**

Player tracking in sports using sensor integration is an evolving area that benefits from precise control and monitoring systems. Employing closed-loop control and finite state machines (FSMs) can significantly enhance the performance of such systems, particularly in wearable tracksuits for players. This report provides detailed steps and specific methods to implement a robust player-tracking system with multiple sensors, leveraging closed-loop control and FSMs.

**ProjectOverview**

The player tracking system involves an Arduino Nano controlling and processing data from the following sensors:

1. **NEO-6M GPS Module**: Provides positional and velocity information.
1. **QMC5883LCompass**: Provides directional data.
1. **Wahoo Sensor**: An accelerometer or heart rate monitor providing physiological or motion data.

**Closed-LoopControl**

Closed-loop control uses feedback to adjust system behaviour. In the context of player tracking, this approach maintains steady signals, optimises sensor orientation, or regulates data acquisition rates.

Method:DynamicGPSSamplingRateAdjustment

1. **Initialisation:**
- Set up the GPS module using the TinyGPS++ library.
- Initialize variables to store position, speed, and time.
2. **Feedback:**
- Read the player’s speed using gps.speed.kmph().
3. **Control:**
- Adjust the GPS sampling rate based on the player’s speed.
- Increasing the sampling rate if the speed is above a threshold (e.g., 10 km/h).
- If the speed is below a threshold, decrease the sampling rate to save power.
4. **Implementation:**
- Use the TinyGPSCustom object to adjust the GPS refresh rate.
- Update the rate dynamically based on the feedback.

**Finite State Machine**

Finite state machines (FSMs) manage system behavior through discrete states and transitions influenced by sensor inputs.

Method:FSMforPlayerTracking

1. **Define States:**
- Idle: Waiting for player movement.
- Tracking: Collecting data from sensors.
- Data Sync: Syncing data with a central server or storage.
- Alert: Generating an alert based on abnormal conditions.
2. **Set Initial State:**
- Set the initial state to Idle.
3. **Implement Transitions:**

4. **Execute FSM Logic:**
- In the main loop, call checkTransitions() to evaluate and execute the state transitions based on sensor feedback and predefined rules.

IntegrationofClosed-LoopControlandFSM

Combining closed-loop control and FSMs enhances the system’s adaptability and robustness:

1. **Closed-loop Control:**
- During the "Tracking" state, the system adjusts the GPS sampling rate based on the player’s speed.
2. **FSM:**
- The FSM manages transitions between "Idle," "Tracking," "Data Sync," and "Alert" states based on sensor feedback and predefined rules.

**Conclusion**

Integrating multiple sensors for player tracking using closed-loop control and FSM provides robust performance in dynamic environments. By combining these methodologies with appropriate hardware and software, systems can achieve adaptive, efficient, and responsive player monitoring in wearable tracksuits, enhancing sports performance and safety.
